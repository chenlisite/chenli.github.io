##Predictive Modeling for Happiness Score

• Applied statistical learning methods(ridge regression, lasso, PCR, PLSR, KNN, SVM) to build prediction models for happiness scores using information from 9 variables

• Used resampling methods to compare the distribution of prediction errors of regression models

• Used ensemble tree-based methods(bagging, boosting, random forest) to build prediction models and identify important variables in prediction

##Data Visualization on Leading Causes of Death
• Used ggplot2, tidyverse, Plotly to visualize and summarize mortality rate among regions through 10 years

• Developed [Flexdashboard](https://wp2241.github.io/final-project-flexdashboard/) and [R Shiny app](https://fionalav.shinyapps.io/Final_prject_shiny/) to create dynamic visualization of public health data
